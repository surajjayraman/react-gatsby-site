Now, in the 2020s, the modular web is emerging as a new architecture for websites. 
Every website role, trying to better serve customers, is adopting specialized cloud-based tools.
Headless CMSs. JavaScript frameworks. Jamstack frame- works. 
Build & deploy platforms. Design tools. Search. Auth. CDPs. Product analytics. Session recording. E-commerce plat- forms, with logistics, rewards, subscriptions, reviews....
This new architecture has a number of benefits – high-per- formance websites, fine-grained analytics, content re-use. 
It also requires certain skillsets to implement, and there are some workflows it doesn’t excel at (yet).

**The birth of cloud computing**
Scaling always-on software services has, historically, been difficult. Complexity abounds – from the physical challenges of maintaining server racks, to the software challenges of network- ing, load-balancing, failovers, backups.
In the mid-2000s, a wave of services promised to leave these problems behind.
Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure – along with smaller players like Heroku or DigitalOcean – promised developers a world where they could stop worrying about infrastructure and systems administration.
From the perspective of engineering or IT, these services simplified planning. 
No more trying to project capacity and budget for servers months in advance. 
Spin up servers when you need them; turn them off when you don’t.
The cloud changed applications architecture. Instead of running in a data center behind a firewall, applications were run in the cloud, accessed via web browser on the public Internet.
